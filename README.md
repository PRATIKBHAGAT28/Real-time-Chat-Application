Our aim is to develop a real-time chat application that offers a seamless and engaging user experience. This application will feature robust capabilities, including file attachments for PDFs, audio, video, and photos, allowing users to share various types of media effortlessly.

Infinite loading or scrolling will ensure users can access chat history smoothly without interruptions. Real-time notifications and typing indications will keep users informed and engaged, enhancing the interactive experience.

Authentication will be implemented to secure user data and manage access, while group chat functionality will facilitate collaborative conversations. To add a dynamic touch, animations for messages will be created using the Framer Motion library. T

he application will be built using cutting-edge technologies such as Socket.IO for real-time communication, JavaScript and TypeScript for robust scripting, Node.js and Express.js for backend development, MongoDB for efficient data storage, and Cloudinary for managing media files.
